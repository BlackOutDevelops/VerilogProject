To fix the datapath:

In datapath.v: 
//  You have to implement the following blocks:
//  o 9-bit comparator (bits > maxcode)
//  o 6-bit table2_addr calculation
//  o Add additional or remove excess latches 
//    to ensure correct timing of signals
//    (look at the timing diagram in the homework to determine where
//     they should go and shouldn't be)

In regfile.v
//  You have to implement the following blocks:
//  o 8-bit code_length SR (provides address to Lookup Table 1)

To fix the control:
In control.v
//  You need to implement logic for FSM machine
